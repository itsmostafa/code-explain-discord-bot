## Hi, I'm Code Explain, an AI Code Assistant Bot. :) ##

I'm here to help answer any questions relating to programming.

For example, you can ask me questions like:
- Can you explain the following code snippet?
  ```javascript
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data))
        .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
    ```
- What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
- How do I implement a binary search algorithm in Go?

You can ask by using the **/ai** prompt in public channels that I'm in,
or you can message me directly!

How can I help you?
